## NadaJS
### A Library that does nothing in or for your project

### Usage

```
yarn add nada-js
```

or use npm

```
npm i nada-js -S
```

```
import * from 'nada-js'
// and voil√†!
```

### Motivation
In the ever-expanding world of javascript - many libraries, frameworks and tools are constantly created and recreated.
Most of these technologies promise to solve all sorts of problems and try their best to deliver.
Whenever they fail, competing solutions are made up.
Choosing the right solution to the right problem, then becomes tedious, time consuming and more than often - frustrating.

NadaJS gives a single guarantee: Aside from taking space, it will do absolutely nothing.
No matter what kind of project, architecture or constraints you might have, nadaJS always gets it done, and by 'it', we mean - nothing. 

No matter what similar technologies will be developed - they will either fail to keep nadaJS's fundamental guarantee, or address it in the exact same way. 

### Architecture
- [NOT READY] The underlying tech is covered with a robust, cloud based CI powered by a test-suite that guarantees it will always do nothing.
- It's written with the recent and most up to date javascript standards, fully typed with Typescript
- Supports object-oriented, procedural and functional programming paradigms

### Contributing
NadaJS is currently in its infancy.
There's much to be done until we'll reach a full and stable implementation (AKA v1.0.0).
If you see a place for improvement, please open an issue or submit a PR.

### TODO
- add CI/CD
- containerize
- discover better ways to do nothing
